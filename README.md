# Secure-GPT-3.5-Interaction-System-with-MultiChain-Authentication

# Project Description:
This project is a comprehensive system that combines client-server architecture with blockchain integration to securely authenticate users and facilitate real-time interactions with GPT-3.5. The system leverages socket programming for communication and MultiChain for secure credential storage.

# Technologies Used:
- Python: For implementing client and server applications, as well as the password hashing and storage utility.
- Socket Programming: For real-time communication between the client and server.
- Pickle Module: For serializing and deserializing data during transmission.
- OpenAI API: For interacting with GPT-3.5.
- MultiChain: For secure storage and retrieval of user credentials.
- Hashlib: For hashing passwords using the SHA-256 algorithm.
- Binascii: For converting data to hexadecimal format.
  
# Usage:
Run the MultiChain Password Hashing and Storage Utility:

Use the utility to hash user passwords and upload them to the MultiChain stream.
Start the Server Application:

Launch the server to start listening for client connections.
Run the Client Application:

Execute the client application to connect to the server, authenticate, and interact with GPT-3.5.

Example Usage:
Store Credentials:
python store_credentials.py

Start Server:
python server.py

Run Client:
python client.py
